    "## Dataset\n",
    "In this homework, we'll build a model for classifying various hair types. For this, we will use the Hair Type dataset that was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kavyasreeb/hair-type-dataset) and slightly rebuilt.\n",

    "You can download the target dataset for this homework from [here](https://github.com/SVizor42/ML_Zoomcamp/releases/download/straight-curly-data/data.zip):\n",

    "## Reproducibility\n",
    "Reproducibility in deep learning is a multifaceted challenge that requires attention to both software and hardware details. In some cases, we can't guarantee exactly the same results during the same experiment runs. Therefore, in this homework we suggest to:\n",

    "* Next, create a convolutional layer ([Conv2D](https://keras.io/api/layers/convolution_layers/convolution2d/)):\n",
    "    * Use 32 filters.\n",
    "    * Kernel size should be `(3, 3)` (that's the size of the filter).\n",
    "    * Use `'relu'` as activation.\n",
    "* Reduce the size of the feature map with max pooling ([MaxPooling2D](https://keras.io/api/layers/pooling_layers/max_pooling2d/)).\n",
    "* Set the pooling size to `(2, 2)`.\n",
    "* Turn the multi-dimensional result into vectors using a [Flatten](https://keras.io/api/layers/reshaping_layers/flatten/) layer\n",
    "* Next, add a `Dense` layer with 64 neurons and `'relu'` activation.\n",
    "* Finally, create the `Dense` layer with 1 neuron - this will be the output.\n",
    "    * The output layer should have an activation - use the appropriate activation for the binary classification case\n",
    "As optimizer use [SGD](https://keras.io/api/optimizers/sgd/) with the following parameters:\n",
    "    * `SGD(lr=0.002, momentum=0.8)`\n",
